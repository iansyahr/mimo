# Mimo
Another No-Database Paste Service

Mimo is a website that lets you share any text with others through links without storing it in a server database. It is heavily inspired by [NoPaste](https://github.com/bokub/nopaste) but uses [brotli-unicode](https://github.com/kyr0/brotli-unicode/) for text compression, which produces a Unicode string. This makes the URL fragment much shorter than using LZMA + Base64.
